# CPU Scheduling System for Operating System
Developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
<hr>

## Basic Introduction
This project simulates CPU scheduling algorithms in an operating system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input different processes with burst times, priorities, and other relevant information to simulate common CPU scheduling algorithms such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling. The system calculates and displays the execution results and performance metrics, such as average waiting time, average turnaround time, and CPU utilization.

The system is developed with a responsive, user-friendly interface that allows users to input process data, select the scheduling algorithm, and view the results instantly. The data is processed using JavaScript, and dynamic results are rendered on the page without the need for reloading.
